# Vision Marquee System
The Vision Marquee System is a program that allows you to create a custom 96x16 Dot Matrix 
Marquee.  With the Vision Marquee, you can display custom messages using several built in 
effects, as well as the ability to display images from file.

The focus of this beta will be to test the user interface to make sure that it is intuitive to use and 
functions error free.  We will also be taking any suggestions for improvements that you might 
think of.  This includes things like new text-based effects or changes in UI functionality and
appearance.

Suggested IDE:  Visual Studio

Built on .NET Framework 4.5.2
